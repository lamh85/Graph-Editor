# Levels of data (from high to low)

Transformations. EG:
* rotate
* skew

SVG coordinates

Interfaces with geometry principles. EG:
* A function that outputs special triangles

Geometry principles. EG:
* Special triangles
* Trigonometry formulas

# Directory structure

Root level - Each folder is a different type of a user and/or environment:
* testing
* webpack build
* source code
* configurations: Babel, etc

Within the source code
1. Divide by different parts of the flow
  * primitive helpers - arrays, strings, etc
  * geometry helpers
  * hooks
  * renders
2.
