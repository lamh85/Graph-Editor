## Directory Structure 

Like with many apps, this codebase is a snapshot of my preferred conventions **of the time**.

**I wrote this app before I learned more about co-location.** So it currently uses the Rails convention for the directory structure, which groups files based on application layer: views, controllers, models, services, etc.

In hindsight, I should have structured the directories based on co-location. My interpretation of co-location:
* Dependent code should share the same directory.
* General UX flows should share the same directory.

To use Google Maps as an example, co-location would make the directory structure look like this:
```
ðŸ“‚ src
  ðŸ“‚ components
    ðŸ“‚ settings (user settings page)
      ðŸ“„ index.tsx 
      ðŸ“„ Heading.tsx
      ðŸ“„ Body.tsx
    ðŸ“‚ navigation (navigation mode)
      ðŸ“„ index.tsx
    ðŸ“‚ map (the main for searching places)
      ðŸ“‚ search-bar
      ðŸ“‚ locations (restaurants, cafes, etc)
        ðŸ“‚ reviews
```

## Typescript

This app currently doesn't use Typescript.
